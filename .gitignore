# Specific Project Files / Directories to Ignore
# ==========================================

# Ignore all contents of the data directory (CSVs, Parquet)
# Add !data/.gitkeep below if you want to keep the empty data folder structure
data/*

# Ignore all contents of the models directory (saved models, scalers, encoders, pca)
# Add !models/.gitkeep below if you want to keep the empty models folder structure
models/*

# Ignore all contents of the results directory (plots, summary csv)
# Add !results/.gitkeep below if you want to keep the empty results folder structure
results/*

# If you want Git to track the *empty* folders (data, models, results) so they
# are created when someone clones the repo, create an empty file named `.gitkeep`
# inside each of these folders and uncomment the lines below:
# !data/.gitkeep
# !models/.gitkeep
# !results/.gitkeep

# Ignore specific generated files if they might appear elsewhere (e.g., root)
